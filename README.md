InsuranceApp
============

An app to play with Object.observe and other goodies (only works in Chrome Canary for now).

Some bits of code are quite verbose and that's on purpose as I don't want people reading it to be confused just because they might not know the default values of certain parameters, etc. 

PS: A very basic example (part of what Addy had shown during his talk on Object.observe) can be viewed [here](http://experiments.muditameta.com/objectObserve/). View it in Chrome Canary.
